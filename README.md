This repository is part of my "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

In day 6, we were asked to help a robot (Reeborg <3) to exit the maze.

``` 
Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.

Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit.

```

What we learned with this example:
- Defining and calling a function.
- Indentation
- While Loops + if/elif/else
